                <h3>Stree 2</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="short-review">Stree 2 continues the story from the first film, where Stree, a vengeful spirit, was weakened by Vicky (Rajkummar Rao)...</span>
                    <span class="full-review" style="display: none;">This sequel introduces Sarkata, a male spirit who kidnaps modern women, leading to a battle with Stree (Shraddha Kapoor). The film starts strong, blending humor and horror, but falters in the second half, focusing more on spectacle than substance. Despite good CGI and pop culture nods, it fails to deliver a meaningful message and doesn’t fully explore its themes on patriarchy and incel culture. Shraddha Kapoor’s role is underdeveloped, and the climax is a confusing, endless battle, resulting in a disappointing and patronizing treatment of women’s empowerment.</span>

                <h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="short-review">In “Deadpool & Wolverine,” Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) humorously mocks Disney and addresses...</span>
                    <span class="full-review" style="display: none;">how the film integrates Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie continues Deadpool's irreverent humor and meta-commentary on superhero conventions. Set within the M.C.U., the film deals with corporate constraints and fan service, using the multiverse to bring in numerous references and cameos. It reflects on Hollywood’s tendency to recycle successful formulas and the commercialization of creativity, making it both entertaining and a critique of the industry's repetitive nature.</span>

                <h3>Spider Man: No Way Home</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="short-review">"Spider-Man: No Way Home" reinvigorates the Spider-Man franchise with an exciting multiverse crossover. Following Peter Parker’s (Tom Holland)...</span>
                    <span class="full-review" style="display: none;">attempt to erase his secret identity with a spell from Dr. Strange, villains from past Spider-Man movies—such as Doc Ock and Green Goblin—return, adding layers to the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime and some thematic repetition, the film delivers with impressive action sequences, particularly a standout battle in a mirror dimension and an emotionally charged final showdown. Michael Giacchino’s score adds heroic depth, complementing the film’s vibrant storytelling. Blending nostalgia with fresh elements, "No Way Home" pays tribute to Spider-Man's legacy while exploring the impact of heroism and responsibility.</span>

                    <span class="short-review">"Rashmi Rocket," inspired by Santhi Soundarajan’s story, highlights systemic bias...</span>
                    <span class="full-review" style="display: none;">against female athletes with hyperandrogenism. The film, featuring Taapsee Pannu, follows Rashmi’s struggle against a system that questions her womanhood. Director Akarsh Khurana emphasizes the broader issue rather than just Rashmi’s personal triumph. Taapsee’s performance is strong, though some plot elements feel underdeveloped. Priyansh Painyuli adds depth as her coach and partner. The film ends with the realization that Rashmi's victory is just the start of a longer battle against systemic injustice.</span>

                    <span class="full-review" style="display: none;">a cash grab. The animation is uninspired, and the plot is predictable, with a rushed and unfinished feel. New characters lack depth, and jokes fall flat, including a cringe-worthy fart joke. Despite a few redeeming elements, such as Viola Davis's villain and James Hong’s performance, the film fails to capture the charm of earlier entries and weakens the franchise’s legacy.</span>

                    <span class="short-review">Ghoomer tells the inspiring story of Anina (Saiyami Kher), a cricketer who, after losing her arm...</span>
                    <span class="full-review" style="display: none;">in an accident, overcomes adversity with the help of former player Paddy (Abhishek Bachchan). Directed by R Balki, the film showcases Anina’s journey from practicing on a makeshift pitch to competing in major stadiums, emphasizing resilience and self-belief.

                        Bachchan delivers a powerful performance as a disillusioned coach, while Kher impresses with her dedication and physicality. The film balances emotional and humorous moments well, and Vishal Sinha’s cinematography captures the cricket scenes vividly.
                        
                        Though it follows familiar themes of a mentor-mentee relationship, Ghoomer remains a compelling and entertaining film, celebrating the strength of perseverance....</span>
